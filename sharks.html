					The shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), also known as the shortfin mako, blue
					pointer, or bonito shark, is a large mackerel shark. It is commonly referred to as the mako shark, as is the longfin
					mako shark (Isurus paucus).[1][4][5] The fastest known shark species, able to reach speeds of 74 km/h (46 mph) in
					bursts, the shortfin mako can attain a size of 4 m (13 ft) in length and weigh 570 kg (1,260 lb). The species is
					classified as Endangered by the IUCN.
					"Mako" comes from the Māori language,[6] meaning either the shark or a shark tooth.

					The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), also known as the white shark, white pointer, or simply great white, is
					a species of large mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans. It is the
					only known surviving species of its genus Carcharodon. The great white shark is notable for its size, with the largest
					preserved female specimen measuring 5.83 m (19.1 ft) in length and around 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) in weight at maturity.[3]
					However, most are smaller; males measure 3.4 to 4.0 m (11 to 13 ft), and females measure 4.6 to 4.9 m (15 to 16 ft) on
					average.
					
					The great white shark is arguably the world's largest-known extant macropredatory fish, and is one of the primary
					predators of marine mammals, such as pinnipeds and dolphins. The great white shark is also known to prey upon a variety
					of other animals, including fish, other sharks, and seabirds. It has only one recorded natural predator, the orca.
